Here are some useful software as you explore AutoASR and the data itself:

AutoASR is on GitHub (updates coming soon): https://github.com/jjvanantwerp/Automated-ASR/

For running AutoASR, you'll need Python3 as well as:
     CD-Hit: https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit
     MAFFT: https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/software/
     IQ-Tree: http://www.iqtree.org/
     The BioPython module: https://biopython.org/wiki/Download

For viewing the results the following software are most useful:
     FigTree: https://github.com/rambaut/figtree/releases 
     AliView:  https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/


The comment at the top of the code gives a brief description of where data are put during analysis, 
but if you have any questions or difficulties, please let me know! I'd value the feedback of where 
to make the user experience more frictionless.
